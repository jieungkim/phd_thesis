\para{Conclusions}
We have developed write-witness-passing, a simple but powerful methodology for
verifying the key safety properties of distributed systems.
This approach can also be easily combined with
the concurrent verification framework~\cite{concurrency}.
Together they provide the tools
to build and verify distributed systems in a scalable and extensible way with 
less human effort required.
As far as we know, our example of Paxos verification
is the first work to mechanically prove the functional correctness
and safety of a distributed protocol written in
a low-level programming language such as C or Assembly.
We believe this is a promising approach that can be applied to many other distributed systems.
In the future we hope to use write-witness-passing to create mechanized proofs of some of the systems we
describe in Section \ref{sec:witness-passing-semantics-with-paxos-variants} as well as other
complicated protocols such as PBFT \cite{pbft}.
