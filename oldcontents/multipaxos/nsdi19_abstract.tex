%\begin{abstract}
We propose the Write-Once Register (WOR) as an abstraction for building and verifying distributed systems. 
A WOR exposes a simple, data-centric API: clients can \prepare{}, write, and read it. 
Applications can use a sequence or a set of WORs to obtain properties such as durability, concurrency control, and failure atomicity. 
By hiding the logic for distributed coordination underneath a data-centric API, the WOR abstraction enables easy, incremental, and extensible implementation and verification of applications built above it. 
We present the design, implementation, and verification of a system called \sysname{} that provides developers with an address space of WORs, implementing each WOR via a Paxos instance. 
We describe three applications built over \sysname{}: a flexible, efficient Multi-Paxos implementation; a shared log implementation with lower append latency than the state-of-the-art; and a fault-tolerant transaction coordinator that uses an optimal number of round-trips. 
\nsdinew{
We show that these applications are simple, easy to verify, and match or surpass the performance of unverified monolithic implementations. 
We use a modular layered verification approach to link the verification proofs for the applications, \sysname{}, and a verified OS to produce an end-to-end verified distributed system stack from the application to the OS.}
