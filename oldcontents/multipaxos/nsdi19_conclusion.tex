\section{Conclusion}

Distributed systems are difficult to design, implement, and verify due to asynchrony and failures. Often, they re-implement the logic for consensus, durability, and availability in slightly different ways. The \WOR{} abstraction proposed in this paper is the least common denominator for strongly consistent, fault-tolerant distributed systems. When exposed as a first-class programming primitive, it enables application stacks that are simple, realizing complex functionality in 100s of lines of code; flexible, allowing for different combinations of high-level application APIs and low-level consensus protocols; and verifiable, enabling layered verification techniques that allow easy, extensible verification of distributed application code.
