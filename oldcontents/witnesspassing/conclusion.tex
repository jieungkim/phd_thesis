\paragraph{Conclusions}

We have presented \sysname{}, a framework for verifying the key safety
properties of leader-based distributed systems. \sysname{} provides the common
template for modeling and specifying leader-based distributed systems and the
template-based proof of linearizability of state update and leader election. 
\sysname{} uses the witness, a novel logical data structure that keeps track of the
history of global state changes and invariants, to facilitate the 
reasoning about the system and the proof. Using \sysname{}, we verify
leader-based distributed systems including multi-Paxos, and compare the system
characteristics based on the \sysname{} template. Thanks to the underlying
certified abstraction layer verification approach that \sysname{} uses,
verified properties of \sysname{} can be connected from the high-level
specification to the C and assembly implementation. 



%As far as we know, our approach is the first work which provides vertical 
%and horizontal compositions on distributed system verification as well as 
%the capability of the full proof linking low-level implementation written in C 
%or Assembly with the high-level representation of the system.

%As far as we know, our example of Paxos verification
%is the first work to mechanically prove the functional correctness
%and safety of a distributed protocol written in
%a low-level programming language such as C or Assembly.
