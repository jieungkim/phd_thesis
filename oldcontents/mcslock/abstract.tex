The MCS Lock, a small but complex piece of low-level software, is a standard algorithm for providing inter-CPU locks with FIFO ordering guarantee and scalability.
It is an interesting target for verification---short and subtle, involving both liveness and safety properties. 
We implemented and verified the MCS Lock algorithm as part of the CertiKOS kernel~\cite{certikos16}, showing that the C/assembly implementation
 {\em contextually refines} atomic specifications of the acquire and release lock methods.
Our development follows the methodology of \emph{certified concurrent abstraction layers}~\cite{dscal15,ccal16}. 
By splitting the proof into layers, we can modularize it into separate parts for the low-level machine model, data abstraction, and reasoning about concurrent interleavings.  This separation of concerns makes the layered methodology suitable for verified programming in the large, and our MCS Lock can be composed with other shared objects in CertiKOS kernel.
