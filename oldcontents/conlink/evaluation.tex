The framework files contains multiple definitions of intermediate languages and , which can be reusable for other purposes with required restrictions that we discuseed in Sect.~\ref{sec:multicore} and Sect.~\ref{sec:multithreaded}.

refinement proofs with those intermediate languages 

framework files contain XXX lines of code (LOC), and
