The goal of this dissertation is to build formal methods for concurrent program verification and apply those techniques to 
multiple examples so we can guarantee to users that these systems are reliable and trustworthy not only in terms of functional correctness 
but also other high-level progress properties or the protocol correctness of them.


\section{Challenges in Concurrent Program Verification}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:challenges-in-concurrent-program-verification}

The prevalence of concurrent environments brings enormous changes to the software. 
They allow for achieving higher performance or more functionality in a single software by using interactions among several instances 
(\ie, multiple threads, nodes, I/O devices, and networks) in the system, 
but they create whole new challenges in terms of providing correctness software. 
Obviously, they are well-known to be difficult to get right and debug because of numerous (usually unbounded)
 interleavings among their multiple components. Testing is necessary to avoid their possible faults, 
 but it is not a promising way to provide their high assurance. Reproducing a bug is unfeasible unless testers know their precise interleaving order.
In this sense, building reliable concurrent programs requires verification to formally shows that they 
correctly reflect the desired behavior (\ie, the behavior stated in their specifications) without missing any single interleaving cases.


In addition, modern software systems consist of multiple sub-modules, 
which are intimately connected with other modules in the system. This brings another source of complexity to the verification. 
These sub-modules highly depend on others, which makes the modular reasoning of each component difficult. 
Accordingly, software verification is considered painful work with prohibitive costs associated with the difficulty of achieving scalability, 
reusability,  and extensibility. 
For example, a famous previous by an seL4 team ~\cite{klein2009sel4} accomplished a breakthrough in software verification 
by providing the first verified (sequential) microkernel and connecting all proofs in a mechanized proof assistant, 
but it required considerable effort. The verification took 11 person years for 7,500 lines of C codes but still contained unverified parts
 (\ie, 1,300 lines of C, 500 lines of assembly, and the compiler to extract the executable code from the verified C codes).
%When combined with concurrency,
%some modules facilitate
%shared operations of other modules
%to form the new shared services.
%It also provides another challenge 
%in the concurrent program verification, 
%which has to resolve not only the interleaving among the concurrent instances as well as the dependencies among the sub-modules 
%that forms the entire system.



%%%%%%%% isolation is required

Therefore, modular and compositional reasoning is indispensable for concurrent program verification. 
The verification should be able to decompose the entire system into a collection of instances (\ie, multiple threads or a set of nodes) and 
further into a stack of modules in each instance; then it needs to be achieved with each module separately without considering complex 
dependencies or interleavings with other modules and instances on the system. Of course, it needs to provide evidence about the system's 
consistency by verifying each module and the behavior of the entire system. 
This modular and compositional software reasoning not only provides an efficient tool for verification 
but also opens the possibility of proving the correct behavior of the system software that is usually parameterized by other programs running on them.
%
%This feature is crucial in some sorts 
%of concurrent programs such as 
%operating systems, libraries, or application interfaces because of the
%proof of them usually needs to be parameterized by 
%other programs running on them. 
%In those cases, composition and proof isolation 
%give enough power to state and prove the correctness property 
%of those programs upon any arbitrary context programs run with the targeted programs. 

%%%%%%%v other previous works 
In this sense, several previous works address modular and/or compositional reasoning with respect to programs--either with or without concurrency.
% need separation logic????
There are two traditional approaches--rely-guarantee ~\cite{jones83} and separation logic ~\cite{ishtiaq01}-and many others 
that stem from either or both of them 
~\cite{feng07:sagl,vafeiadis:marriage,LRG,fu10:roch,sergey15, lili16,Vafeiadis11mfps, Yang07relsep,
Liang14lics}.
Besides, some approaches not only focus on functional correctness but also shows liveness~\cite{lili16}.
However, most previous works do not provide a programming framework that addresses all the above challenges
in concurrent program verification and is capable of extracting the running code from the program written in low-level programming 
languages such as C and assembly.

\section{Verification Toolkit for Concurrent Programs}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:verification-toolkit-for-concurrent-programs}
%
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/intro}
%\caption{Verification Toolkit Structure}
%\label{chapter:intro:verific	tion-toolkit-structure} 
%\end{figure}
With those investigations, we present the toolkit that supports modular and compositional verification for concurrent programs. 
The toolkit consists of two parts: 1) propose the method to build local layer interfaces for concurrent program verification; and 
2) provide the concurrent-linking framework. All layers and linking parts are also connected with the traditional simulation 
technique~\cite{compcert, deepspec}. 
 
The first part of our toolkit is to construct certified concurrent abstraction layers: a new compositional model for concurrency, 
a program verifier for concurrent C and assembly, and a verified C compiler. 
Each layer interface in our framework functions as an executable machine which consists of state and multiple transition rules. 
To divide the program into fine-grained pieces, we follow the idea of abstraction layers, which are widely used in modern computer systems. 
Our layered approach also reduces the complex dependency among the sub-modules in the entire system.
We use the verified compiler for this layered approach to minimize the trusted parts between the verified program and the executable code 
on a bare machine. Programs written and verified with our toolkit use a subset of C language, 
which can be compiled into $\intelmachine$ assembly language via $\compcertx$, which is the variance of verified C compiler $\compcert$.

This first part of our verification toolkit has several distinctive features which stem from the requirements of 
a sizeable concurrent system. First, it is suitable for dealing with the low-level code. To make the proofs tractable, 
we mainly work at the C level (relying on the $\compcert$ verified compiler~\cite{compcert}), 
but we sometimes need to go lower. 
For example, the MCS algorithm needs to use atomic CPU instructions (fetch-and-store and compare-and-swap), 
so we need a way to mix C and assembly code. At the same time, C itself is too low-level to reason about conveniently, 
so we need data abstraction to hide the details about representation in memory. 
Our toolkit provides an efficient way to verify C and assembly programs as well as connect the data abstraction 
with detailed representations in memory. Second, to handle large developments, we need separation of responsibilities. 
In a small proof of a small concurrent program in isolation, 
you can state the specification as a single pre- and post-condition which specifies the shape and ownership of the data structure, 
the invariants of the liveness conditions, and even the behavior of the entire system. 
But such a proof is not modular and not reusable. In our development, 
these are done as separate refinement steps in separate modules with explicit interfaces, 
and they can even be the responsibility of different software developers. 
Finally, the layers approach is general purpose in the sense that the same semantic framework can be used for proving all kinds of properties. 
The model of program execution exposed to the programmer is simpleâ€”mostly the same as what you would use for sequential code, 
and with a notion of logs of events to model concurrency. We did not have to add any special features to the logic to show high-level 
properties (such as a liveness property) because we could directly reason in $\coq$ about how long an execution will take.

The other part of our toolkit is to provide the connection between multiple concurrent instances in the system. 
Our certified concurrent abstraction layers provide the way to build and verify concurrent programs by decoupling 
the complex interleaving from the correctness proof of each layer in the system. 
This compositional requires each layer to use assumptions on the environment of the layer interface--the behavior of other concurrent components 
in the system. 
Those assumptions inevitably need to be compatible with the properties that other concurrent components can guarantee; 
thus, proving this property is desirable for our concurrent program verification toolkit. To fulfill this requirement, 
we provide the concurrent linking library as a part of our toolkit, which includes defining concurrent machine 
models and providing generic proof methods to show the validity in the parallel composition of multiple instances as well as 
the formal connection between the program on concurrent machine models and the program on the local layer interface.

Our linking library also has several unique aspects to apply it to large concurrent system verification. 
First, our concurrent machine semantics are generic enough to be applied to arbitrary programs written in our layered framework. 
We separate the linking process from the concurrent layer building so users do not have to deal with the details of linking itself when they 
build concurrent layers using our framework. Second, it also can be linked with the assembly model for the verified compiler $\compcertx$, thus
 providing the full formal connection between the program written in C and assembly and the data abstraction for the detailed data 
 representation on the memory. Third, it provides complex dependencies among multiple data structures in large concurrent programs. 
 This is not only related to the dependencies among shared objects in the program but also the dependencies between 
 shared and private objects. Our toolkit handles all those issues with reasonable restrictions.

\section{Concurrent Program Verification Examples}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:concurrent-program-verification-examples}


As examples of the applicability of our framework, we verified two large-scale concurrent systems--$\certikos$ and $\wormspace$.
These examples also represent two models for concurrent programs: 
the shared-memory model of concurrency and the message-passing model.

A concurrent operating system is a well-known example of the shared-memory model for concurrency that multiple threads 
in the system share the same physical memory or a common 
file system. Operating system verification has been studied for a while with impressive results~\cite{klein2009sel4, xu16, hawblitzel10}.
However, these studies either lack supporting fine-grained lock control on shared resources or lack progress property proofs of their kernels.
 On the other hand, $\certikos$ is the first verified concurrent operating system kernel with fine-grained locking. 
 The kernel is written in C and assembly, and the extracted code of the kernel (via verified compositional compilation) 
 runs on an $\intelmachine$ multicore machine. It consists of 6,500 lines of C and assembly implementation and 200K+ lines of $\coq$ proofs.

To manage such a massive verification work, we divide the kernel into multiple sub-modules and link them together to form the 
correctness theorem of the kernel. This work not only facilitates the abstraction-layer approach in our framework 
but also uses our concurrent-linking framework to show the simulation relation between 
the program on each instance with its concurrent environment and the program runs on the full 
concurrent machine--the $\intelmachine$ multicore machine. 

We also built a spinlock module to support fine-grained lock services for multiple shared objects in the kernel 
(\ie, page allocation, atomic queue, \etc).
The MCS Lock--one of two lock algorithms we used--verification is described in detail in this thesis, 
focusing on how we divided the requirement of lock verification into multiple layers, proving
liveness of the lock and providing a simple but common interface of the verified lock for other shared resources.

The MCS algorithm is well-known in scalable fair inter-CPU mutex locks. 
Although the program is short, the proof is challenging. First, the implementation of a lock algorithm cannot itself use locks, 
so it must rely solely on atomic-memory instructions and be robust against any possible interleavings between CPUs. 
This is the most challenging type of concurrency--so-called lock-free programming.
Second, unlike algorithms which only promise mutual exclusion, the MCS algorithm also aims for fairness among CPUs.
To check that it got it right, our correctness theorem needs to guarantee not only mutual exclusion (a safety property) but also bounded waiting time (a liveness property). We show how we resolve these challenges in this thesis.


Our verification toolkit is inspired by the $\certikos$ project, but it is not limited to operating system verification. 
Distributed systems are well-known as the message-passing model of concurrency, where nodes in distributed systems are connected with 
others via network communication. They serve millions of users in important applications
 these days (\ie, banking, communications, and social networking), but they are difficult programs to be correctly implemented 
 due to their concurrency and their failures. Local nodes may crash at arbitrary moments, and communications may possess failures 
 such as packet reordering, loss, and duplication. In this sense, distributed systems are a desirable target for verification to 
 show the applicability of our framework.

To build a trustworthy distributed system, we first introduce the WOR abstraction inherent in many distributed systems and present a simple, 
data-centric WOR API as a first-class programming abstraction.  
Next, we implement three distributed applications over this API; for each, our modular design easily allows new configurations 
with different performance and availability properties while matching or surpassing the performance of an existing monolithic implementation 
in a similar configuration. Finally, we apply our verification toolkit into distributed systems by adding a 
non-Byzantine band asynchronous network model (which allows packet duplication, delay, and loss). We built WormSpace, 
which is a distributed system API that provides the abstraction of the common interfaces that many distributed systems can use. 
The system is implemented via a collection of Paxos, and we prove its functional correctness as well as the key safety property of the 
protocol--immutability.


\section{Toolkit for Leader-based Distributed Protocols and Systems}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:toolkit-for-leader-based-distributed-protocols-and-systems}


The verification of distributed systems reveals another challenge beyond showing their functional correctness of those programs: 
the safety proofs of their underlying protocols. While even verifying a single distributed system is challenging, in practice, distributed applications 
rely on several distributed systems. An application might employ different distributed systems for distinct functionalities (\eg,
consensus~\cite{vivaladifference}, distributed transactions~\cite{gray:2006},
and distributed locks~\cite{chubby, zookeeper} as part of a high-reliability distributed database),
or it might use systems that achieve the same goal 
 (\eg,
multi-Paxos~\cite{paxosmadesimple, rvrpaxos} vs. Raft~\cite{raft})in different parts, depending on performance considerations or simple preference.
 Therefore, to realize a verified distributed system environment, methodologies to extend formal reasoning to multiple distributed systems are necessary.

We find that distributed systems that realize strong semantics are typically designed under a common pattern: 
they exploit a leader node (or a centralized coordinator) explicitly or implicitly to coordinate distributed state changes. Indeed, 
for simplicity of management and understanding, this leader-based scheme is commonly used to implement critical distributed functions. 
For example, multi-Paxos and Raft elect a leader to replicate states across multiple nodes, two-phase commit employs a transaction manager to
 coordinate transactions over various resource managers, and coordination services grant a lock to a requester to allow for mutually exclusive 
 access to a distributed shared state. 
 To account for this, our dissertation proposes an idea that can be used in the distributed system 
 verification--especially leader-based distributed systems.

\section{Contributions by Collaborators}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:contributions-by-collaborators}

The works in chapters~\ref{chapter:ccal},~\ref{chapter:mcs-lock},~\ref{chapter:linking}, and \ref{chapter:certikos} are parts of 
the $\certikos$ project, and were jointly done with various members in our group.
The author collaborated with Ronghui Gu on developing concurrent certified abstraction layers, concurrent linking libraries, and the verification on the verified concurrent OS kernel ($\certikos$).  
The author wrote almost all proofs in linking libraries and concurrent-linking proofs for $\certikos$ with some help from 
J{\'e}r{\'e}me Koenig.
Among the entire $\certikos$, 
the author developed the whole MCS Lock module with Vilhelm Sj{\"o}berg,
who also contributed to many other parts. The automation engine for proving the C source program were developed solely by Xiongnan (Newman) Wu,
 but its details are out of scope in this thesis. Wuâ€™s thesis illustrates in-depth explanations about the automation engine. 
 For the case study on distributed system verification in Chapter~\ref{chapter:wormspace} ($\wormspace$), Ji-Yong Shin and Wolf Honore 
 worked together to build and verify the system, and the author had a leading role in designing the network models, 
 layers for the target system, and safety proof of the system.
 The author also worked with Ji-Yong Shin and Wolf Honore to provide a verification toolkit for leader-based distributed systems 
 in Chapter~\ref{chapter:witness-passing}.

\section{Contents of the Chapters}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:contents-of-the-chapters}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking} provides the details for our concurrent-linking, multicore linking, and multithreaded-linking frameworks, 
of which the high-level idea is part of our work in~\cite{concurrency}.
However, this chapter differs from our previous publications by providing in-depth explanations for the parts related to concurrent linking, 
thus addressing how to use our linking framework by presenting formal rules, proofs, and its true capability, 
which are also addressed in~\cite{concurrency}.

%
%However, even with the importance of concurrent program verification and 
%a large body of recent work on shared-memory concurrency verification ~\jieung{cite},
%there are few certified programming tools for a large scale software due to the requirement of multiple challenges described in Fig.~\ref{fig:concurrent-verification-challenge}.
%
%\jieung{ need to site ESOP papers too}
%
%They first have to 
%provide a way to build the software in multiple layers
%that enable us to build a large scale program as a modular way. 
%For example, 
%operating systems can be divided into multiple parts, 
%memory management, process management, and so on.
%
%They also have to provide \jieung{need different word} a methodology to 
%represent the behavior of other components in the concurrent environment. 
%For the program running on multicore environment, 
%the single instance of the program, which is a program runs on top of 
%a single CPU, has to correctly capture the 
%environmental behavior (the behavior of programs on other CPUs). 
%
%In addition to that, 
%providing the end-to-end theorem also requires us 
%to link the multiple proof instances to 
%form a single proof that is based on
%the concurrent environment itself which does not have 
%any environmental contexts at all. 
%In the example of the operating system on multicore environment,
%the end-to-end theorem 
%has to prove that 
%the program running on the single CPU is correctly refined by 
%the whole thread programs running on the multicore machine. 
%
%Previous works, CertiKOS~\jieung{need cite} and Certified Concurrent Abstraction Layer~\jieung{need cite}, 
%tackles all the above examples.  
%CCAL is a tool to build a certified concurrent layers, which provides 
%a way to build concurrent abstraction layers, 
%
%
%
%However, the paper does not handle how the linking process works with the concrete machine models. 
%It briefly mentions the high level idea of linking and the memory extension for linking framework. 
%
%Therefore, this paper aims the gap between the high level perspective of CCAL and the 
%low level details of concurrent proof linking. 
%This low level details contains two parts. 
%First, it requires us to define and build multiple intermediate languages to connect
%the x86 multicoro machine model with the LAsm, which is the machine model for one single CPU. 
%In addition to that, 
%the framework also needs to show the refinement 
%between layers on those intermediate machine models to formally link
%all those proofs together. 
%CCAL also briefly provide the idea of how they implement the practical machine models that can be used with CompCertX.
%However, only providing few details does not provide 
%the  useful information to show how it works with the actual running large scale software.
%Thus, our paper tackles the issues that CCAL overlooked in the paper 
%by providing the formal rules and proofs.
%The key contribution of this paper is as follows: 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item We provide the detailed intermediate language semantics for multicore machine model based on CCAL, 
%and instantiate all those intermediate language semantics and refinement proofs 
%to link them with CompCertX with environmental context 
%\item We provide the intermediate machine models to build single threaded machine model from a single CPU machine model. 
%Based on the machine models, we provide the linking theorem in between 
%two abstraction layers, which contains different semantics for software schedulers. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%The structure of remaining paper is as follows:
%Section~\ref{sec:overview} shows a brief high level idea of CCAL as well as how our linking works. Section~\ref{sec:multicore} shows the details of multicore linking,
%and Sect.~\ref{sec:multithreaded} shows the implementation of our intermediate machine models for our multithreaded environment.
%Section~\ref{sec:multithreaded-linking-impl} shows how are framework 
%can be fitted into the actual concurrent kernel implementations.
%Evaluations about our implementation can be found in Sect.~\ref{sec:evaluation} 
%and the related work and conclusion is in Sect.~\ref{sec:related}.
%
%
%
%\ignore{
%Despite the importance of concurrent layers and a large body of recent work on 
%shared-memory concurrency verification, 
%
%
%there are no certified programming tools that can specify, compose, and compile concurrent layers to form a whole system [6]. Formal reasoning across multiple concurrent layers is challenging because different layers often exhibit different interleaving semantics and have a different set of observable events. For example, the spinlock module in Fig. 1 assumes a multicore model with an overlapped execution of instruction streams from different CPUs. This model differs significantly from the multithreading model for building high-level synchro- nization libraries: each thread will block instead of spinning if a queuing lock or a CV event is not available; and it must count on other threads to wake it up to ensure liveness.
%
%
%
%
%many of these abstraction layers also become concurrent in nature. Their interfaces not only hide the concrete data representations and algorithmic de- tails, but also create an illusion of atomicity for all of their methods: each method call is viewed as if it completes in a single step, even though its implementation contains com- plex interleavings with operations done by other threads. Herlihy et al. [19, 20] advocated using layers of these atomic objects to construct large-scale concurrent software systems.
%
%
%The importance of software systems' accuracy is growing rapidly these days. 
%In addition to that, 
%the concurrent environment, including multicore and device drivers, are ubiquitous in modern periods. 
%Therefore, 
%the verification methodology for concurrent programs is critical now. 
%
%In this sense, several previous works propose
%proof logics and tools for that purpose \jieung{need cite}.
%
%However, few of them are working on the linking multiple instances of 
%verified concurrent programs with concrete machine models that can be run 
%on the bare machines. 
%
%One tool, Certified Concurrent Abstraction Layers, 
%provides the tool that can be used for building a practical concurrent programs 
%such as a small operating system or distributed system. 
%It also provides the tool to link the 



%
%
%Formal verification is a key to secure and reliable software, and  Operating System (OS) kernels and hypervisors form the backbone of every safety-critical software system in the world. 
%Hence it is highly desirable to formally verify the correctness of these programs.
%
%Recent work on $\selfour$~\cite{klein2009sel4,klein14} has shown that it is feasible to formally prove the functional correctness property of a general-purpose microkernel, but the cost of such verification is still quite prohibitive. 
%It took the $\selfour$\ team more than 11 person years (effort for tool development excluded) to verify 7500 lines of sequential C code, yet the resulting kernel still contains 1200 lines of additional C code and 600 lines of assembly code that are not verified. 
%Worse still, even after all these efforts, the current verified $\selfour$\ kernel cannot be used to reason about user-level programs as it does not verify important features such as virtual-memory page faults and address translation.
%
%There are many reasons that make hard to verify the OS kernels formally.
%First, OS kernels are complex artifacts; they contain many interdependent components that are difficult to untangle.
%Their invariants can involve machine level details (e.g., how the virtual memory hardware works) but can also cut across multiple abstraction boundaries (e.g., different views of an address space under kernel/user or host/guest modes).
%Several researchers~\cite{baumann12,vaynberg12} observed that even writing down a good and easy-to-maintain formal specification alone is already a major roadblock for any such verification effort.
%
%Second, OS kernels are often written in C, which only supports limited forms of abstraction.  Verification of C programs is especially hard if they manipulate low-level data structures (e.g., thread queues, allocation tables).  
%The $\selfour$\ effort used an intermediate executable specification (derived from a Haskell prototype) to hide some messy C specifics, but this alone is not enough for enforcing abstraction among different kernel components; $\selfour$\ had to introduce capabilities which add significant implementation complexities to the kernel.
%
%Third, OS kernels are developed for managing and multiplexing hardware, so it is important to have a machine model that can describe hardware details.
%The C language (especially ANSI C) is too high level for this purpose. For example, while most kernel code can be written in C, many key kernel concepts (e.g., context switches, address translation, page fault handling) can only be given accurate semantics at the assembly level. Consequently, we need a formal assembly model to define many kernel behaviors, but we also want to verify most kernel code at a much higher abstraction level.
%
%Fourth, OS kernel verification would not scale if it does not  support extensibility.
%One advantage of a verified kernel is the existence of formal specifications for all of its components. 
%In theory, this would allow us to add certified kernel plug-ins as long as they do not violate any existing kernel invariants.
%In practice, however, if we are unable to decompose kernel invariants into small independent pieces, even modifying an existing (or adding a new) verified component may force us to rewrite the proofs for the entire kernel.
%
%Hence, OS kernel and hypervisor verification needs a novel compositional approach that can handle all of the above challenges successfully. 
%Previous work~\cite{deepspec} in our group presents a verified OS kernel and hypervisor with solving those problems. 
%However, there are still limitations in two verified kernels~\cite{deepspec, klein2009sel4}.
%For example, both of them only support single processor systems.

%
%
%In this thesis, we present a compositional, and powerful automation engine for effectively verifying complex system software. We believe that the aforementioned challenges are not directly tied to the verification of the functional correctness itself, and we think the automation engine should focus solely on providing very strong automation support for proving the functional correctness of each system component, completely separate from the reasoning of aforementioned challenges. We have developed a strong automation tactical libraries that solely focus on proving functional correctness, and provide a separate logical framework to handle memory isolation, i
