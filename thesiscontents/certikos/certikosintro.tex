%In this chapter, we briefly present our work published in OSDI 2016~\cite{certikos:osdi16}, especially 
how CCAL in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal} and concurrent linking libraries in Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking} are applied 
to verify a large-scaled and practical concurrent operation system, CertiKOS.
Our certified kernel is written in 6500 lines of C and x86 assembly
and runs on stock x86 multicore machines. This is
the first proof of functional correctness of a complete,
general-purpose concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking.
