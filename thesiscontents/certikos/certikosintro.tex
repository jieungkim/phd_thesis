This chapter presents our work on a large-scaled concurrent program verification, and
especially 
how $\ccalname$ in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal} and the concurrent-linking framework in Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking} are applied 
to verify a large-scaled and practical concurrent-operation system, $\certikos$.
We divide the full OS kernel as a stack of layers, independently verify them, 
and connect them via our layer-linking library. 
Also,
we glue multiple instances in a concurrent program together by using concurrent-linking (composition) templates, both for multicore and multithreaded concurrency. 
Our certified kernel is written in 6,500 lines of C and x86 assembly
and runs on a $\intelmachine$ multicore machine with supporting fine-grained locking via spinlock modules.
$\certikos$ is the first proof of functional correctness of a complete,
general-purpose concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking,
which supports a single top-level correctness theorem. 


\jieung{ Few things to consider: 
1) I used one figure from CertiKOS paper. Is it OK?: 2) I try to minimize the descriptions of per CPU module and per Thread module to distinguish those parts with others' dissertations. But, can I add more texts for  them if it is necessary: 2) I did not include performance evaluations in here, cause my dissertation is not related to anything about them, as well as those parts  are already in others' dissertations.}
