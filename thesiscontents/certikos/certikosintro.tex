\jieung{ I included some figures that others' added in their dissertations. Is it ok?}

\jieung{I try to minimize the descriptions of per CPU module and per Thread module to distinguish those parts with 
others' dissertations. But, can I add more texts for  them?} 

\jieung{I did not include performance evaluations in here, cause my dissertation is not related to anything about them, as well as those parts 
are already in others' dissertations.} 

In this chapter, we briefly present our work on concurrent operating system verification, especially 
how $/ccalname$ in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal} and concurrent linking libraries in Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking} are applied 
to verify a large-scaled and practical concurrent operation system, $\certikos$.
Our certified kernel is written in 6500 lines of C and x86 assembly
and runs on stock x86 multicore machines. This is
the first proof of functional correctness of a complete,
general-purpose concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking,
which supports a single top-level correctness theorem. 
%
%We have successfully developed a fully certified concurrent OS kernel n $\coq$~\cite{coq}. Using $\certikos$ as the base, 
%we also provide variance of certified kernels, including hypervisor.
%Our kernel cointain fine-grained locking 
%as well as sleep-and-wakeup primitives, and can run on 
%
%Our kernels support both fine-grained locking and sleep- wakeup primitives and can run on stock x86 multicore hardware. Our certified hypervisor kernel consists of 6000 lines of C and x86 assembly, and can boot a version of Linux as a guest. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking.

The overall structure of our top-level theorem for $\certikos$ is described in...
