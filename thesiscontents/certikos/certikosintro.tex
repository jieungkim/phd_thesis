This chapter presents our work on a large-scale concurrent program verification, 
with a particular focus on how $\ccalname$ (presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal}) and the concurrent linking framework (presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking}) are applied to verify a large-scale and practical concurrent-operation system, $\certikos$. 
We divide the full OS kernel as a stack of layers, independently verify them, and connect them via our layer-linking library. 
Also, we glue multiple instances in a concurrent program together by using concurrent linking (composition) templates for 
both multicore and multithreaded concurrency. 
Our certified kernel is written in 6,500 lines of C and  $\intelmachine$ assembly and runs on a  $\intelmachine$ multicore machine with supporting fine-grained locking via spinlock modules. 
$\certikos$ is the first proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking that supports a single top-level correctness theorem.
