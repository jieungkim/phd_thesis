\section{Multicore Linking for CertiKOS}
\label{chapter:certikos:sec:multicore-linking-for-certikos}

Multicore linking in CertiKOS facilitates all the intermediate languages
and proofs in Section~\ref{chapter:linking:sec:multicore-linking}.
Figure~\ref{fig:chapter:conlink:intermediate-languages-and-their-relationsihps-for-multicore-linking} and 
Section~\ref{chapter:linking:sec:multicore-linking} show all definitions and 
proofs that connect all those things. 
However, to build the local layer interface, 
Instantiating the hardware configuration, 
use the concrete definition $L$, which will be the 
bottom layer of our local layer interface, 
and combine those intermediate languages and proofs with $\compcert$ semantic and backward simulation 
forms to connect them rigorously.
