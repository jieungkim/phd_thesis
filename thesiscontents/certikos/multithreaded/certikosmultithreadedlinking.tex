\section{Multithreaded Linking for CertiKOS}
\label{chapter:certikos:sec:multithreaded-linking-for-certikos}

Multithreaded linking for $\certikos$ is connecting the top-most layer of CPU layer
 interface with
the corresponding bottom-most layer in the thread layer interface. 
The biggest difference between those two layers is 
the way to handle scheduling primitive.
