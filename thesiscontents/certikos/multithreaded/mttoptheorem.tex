\subsection{Connecting Multithreaded-Linking Theorem}
\label{chapter:certikos:subsec:connecting-multithreaded-theroem}

The top-level theorem of
multithreaded linking in $\certikos$  is in Theorem~\ref{theorem:chapter:certikos:contextual-refinement-theorem-in-certikos-multithreaded-linking}.

\begin{theorem}[Multithreaded-Linking Theorem for $\certikos$]
\label{theorem:chapter:certikos:contextual-refinement-theorem-in-certikos-multithreaded-linking}
Let's assume that $cid$ is a valid CPU ID, $\oracle_{cid}$ is a valid
environmental context for CPU $cid$, 
$\oracle_{tid}$ is a valid
environmental context for thread $tid$, 
and $\codeinmath{Ctxt}$ is a
 context program that runs on top of layer $\codeinmath{PHThrd}$. 
 Then, we can state that
 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
$\semwmachine{\PLayer{\codeinmath{PBThrd}}{cid}{\oracle_{cid}}}{\codeinmath{Ctxt}}{\codeinmath{mach}_{\lasm}} \refines_{R_{\codeinmath{mtlink}}} \semwmachine{\PLayer{\codeinmath{PHThrd}}{tid}{\oracle_{tid}}}{\codeinmath{Ctxt}}{{\codeinmath{mach}_{\hasm}}}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
when ${R_{\certikos_\codeinmath{mtlink}}}$ is a refinement relation for multithreaded linking, and $tid$ is a member of $T_{[cid]}$,
which implies a full thread set on CPU $cid$.
\end{theorem}


The proof for Theorem~\ref{theorem:chapter:certikos:contextual-refinement-theorem-in-certikos-multithreaded-linking} 
can be divided into multiple sub-lemmas, each of which is a backward-simulation proof 
that facilitates  refinement theorems in Section~\ref{chapter:linking:sec:multithreaded-linking}. 
The overall structure of the proof is in Figure~\ref{fig:chapter:certikos:multithreaded-connect-proof-overall-structure}, which is 
similar to the multithreaded-linking framework structure (in Figure~\ref{fig:chapter:linking:multithreaded-linking-structure}) but does not rely on
any abstract thread configurations,  abstract layers ($\TSched$, $\TLink$, and $\CSched$), or 
 abstract relations between those layers ($\codeinmath{AbstractRel}$ and $\codeinmath{AbstractRelT}$).

However, providing concrete instances for those abstract definitions is tedious and requires a lot of proof efforts. 
Our future direction is to reduce the cost of multithreaded linking by minimizing the cost for building 
them.

%\subsection{Layer Refinement for Thread Linking}\label{subsec:concrete-impl}
%
%From Sec.~\ref{subsec:lowlevelasm} to Sec.~\ref{subsec:hasm} ,
%we show the whole process to 
%build a thread-local layer interface
%that tackles 
%multiple challenges stated in Sec.~\ref{subsec:fulleasm}.
%However, introducing this interface does not mean that all about building thread-local layers and 
%linking multiple thread-local layers are straightforward. 
%When looking at the refinement theorems in previous sections,
%some are purely logical and only depend on machine model levels, 
%but two of them, Theorem~\ref{theorem:easm_refine_lasm} and Theorem~\ref{theorem:hasm-refines_tasm} 
%are relying on the abstract relation between two layers. 
%To prove them, we have to introduce the instance of $\mathrm{PH}$ which satisfies both 
%$\absrel(\simrel(st_{\EAsmM{}}, st_{\AsmLM}), \mathrm{PH}, \CSched)$ and 
%$\absrelt(\simrel(st_{\AsmHM}, st_{\TAsmM{}}), \TSched, \mathrm{PH})$.
%This instantiation also includes how we define concrete implementations of
%abstract definitions that we have introduced in our multiple machine models. 
%In this sense, we introduce a concrete layer $\TLink$, an instance of $\mathrm{PH}$
%to give the evidence for the abstract definition in those two refinement theorems.
%
%Instantiating $\TLink$ contains multiple challenges, too.
%We first need to divide $adt$ in $\AsmLM$ $\AsmHM$  into two separate data types, $\dshare$ and $\dproc$, and
%define specifications  $(\spec^{_{def}}_{_{id}})$  for all primitives (except $\yield$ and $\sleep$) 
%and memory access semantics based on the  
%newly defined data types. 
%Obviously, some data structures, such as a memory page permission table or an IPC (inter process communication) channel, 
%cannot be trivially divided into into multiple thread-wise data structures.
%In this sense, dividing the whole data structure of concurrent system requires a deep knowledge about how the system works,
%and requires an amount of effort. 
%
%In addition, proving concrete implementations for all abstract definitions that we have introduced to model multiple intermediate machines
%is an another step of works in this phase. 
%For example, $\updatefun$ should have concrete definitions for the primitives that raise events
%and the behavior of the function have to be consistent with the specifications of those primitive 
%in terms of updating shared data states. 
%Also, $\initdproc$ needs to search a proper thread-create event 
%and construct a valid initial private data for each thread.
%This behavior also keeps a consistent behavior with that of thread creation in CPU-local machine in 
%$\CSched$. 
%
%When looking at the details of $\absrelt$, which relies on $\simrel(st_{\AsmHM}, st_{\TAsmM{}})$,
%most cases in the simulation relation are straightforward because 
%the relation is between two thread-local machines even though their machine models are different. 
%With the given relation, providing the evidence of $\absrelt$ consists of 
%1) all primitive specifications in $\TSched$ on $\AsmHM$ is consistent with the all primitive specifications in 
%$\TLink$ on $\TAsmM{}$, and
%2) all primitive can generate a proper event in $\TAsmM{}$. 
%
%However, $\absrel$ with $\simrel(st_{\EAsmM{}}, st_{\AsmLM})$ contains a plethora of challenges and corner cases. 
%Defining a simulation relation between the shared data in $\EAsmM{}$ with the corresponding data in $\AsmLM$ is simple. 
%On the other hand, in several cases in the private data, defining a simulation relation 
%contains a lot of sophisticated cases because here is the place that we actually link per-thread data structures as 
%a single per CPU data structures.
%For example, to divide user memory to each thread successfully, 
%exclusiveness property of our memory page allocation mechanism should be guaranteed and proved. 
%To guarantee the consistent behavior between 
% $\EAsmM{}$ and $\AsmLM$ in user context values, our simulation relation
%has to distinguish the case when the thread is not created yet and the case after it is created.
%This implies that we have to prove several additional lemmas for all primitives 
%including  disjoint property of user memories, 
%and correctness of thread-local behavior in thread creation and IPC, etc.
%With those auxiliary lemmas and simulation relation, proving the evidence of $\absrel$ consists of 
%1) all primitive specifications in $\TLink$ on $\EAsmM{}$ with all threads on CPU $c$ are consistent with  all primitive specifications in $\CSched$ on $\AsmLM$ with CPU $c$, and
%2) all events have consistent behaviors with corresponding primitive specifications in terms of shared data updating.
%
%By introducing evidences of those two abstract relations, $\absrel$ and $\absrelt$, we finally achieve an instance for a thread-local layer interface, and link multiple thread-local layers to refine it into a single CPU-local layer.
%This separation between a machine level and an actual implementation level not only makes us to enable our thread linking but also
%gives us generality and scalability 
%of our thread-linking framework.
%$\CSched$ and $\TSched$ layers contain more than $35$ primitives. 
%If we prove the refinement property for all primitives in all different machine level refinement theorems, 
%the proof size will become much bigger than now and 
%easily become unmanageable even though we use an interactive theorem prover, Coq, to prove them. 
%However, thanks to our decoupling in our modeling and proofs, we can successfully prove these all related proofs about thread linking with reasonable efforts.
%In addition to that,
%if we want to add more primitives in $\CSched$  and $\TSched$, we do not need to prove the whole refinement and linking theorems 
%that we have stated in previous sections. 
%All those theorems will remain as same, and
%the thing that we only have to change is updating $\absrel$ and $\absrelt$ instances according to the newly added data structures and primitives.
