\label{chapter:certikos:subsec:layer-on-intermediate-languages-in-multithreaded-linking}

Our intermediate layer definition has a different state definition (not only for the memory and registers, but also for the abstract data); thus we also provide the

In addition to that, our intermediate machine models has explicit

They are defined in the lanuage level
