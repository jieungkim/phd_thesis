Concurrent abstraction layers provide a common way to build modern software systems because concurrency raised by multicore environment and multithreaded programming is common.
They, however, are hard to get to be right or debug because of complex interleaving among multiple components in the system. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers are highly desirable to provide a 
high-assurance concurrent software development. 

Therefore, we present a new way to build and verify concurrent abstraction layers 
based on contextual refinement proofs and environmental contexts,
thus provide a robust methodology to decompose complex concurrent systems into multiple layers for modular building and verification.
The goal of this chapter is to provide high-level descriptions of our methodology to show how to build and verify concurrent abstraction layers.
Later chapters in this dissertation further expose complex parts such as a concurrent linking of our approach
and demonstrate the applicability of our method by providing several examples.
