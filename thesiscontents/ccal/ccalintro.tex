%In this chapter, we present our work published in PLDI 2018~\cite{concurrency}.
Concurrent abstraction layers are a common way to 
build modern software systems 
because concurrency raised by multicore environment and multithreaded programming. 
They, however, are well known to get to be right or to debug due to 
the complex interleaving among multiple components in the system. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers 
are highly desirable to provide a 
high-assurance concurrent software development. 

In this sense, we present Certified Concurrent Abstraction Layers (CCAL), which is a fully mechanized programming toolkit.
The toolkit aids programmers to specify, compose, compile, and link programs written in
concurrent abstraction layers.
