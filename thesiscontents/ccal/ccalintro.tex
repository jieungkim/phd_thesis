Concurrent abstraction layers provide a common method for building modern software systems since concurrency raised by a multicore environment and multithreaded programming is common. 
However, they are difficult to successfully complete and debug due to complex interleaving among multiple system components. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers are highly desirable to provide high-assurance concurrent software development.

As such, we present a novel method of building and verifying concurrent abstraction layers based 
on contextual refinement proofs and environmental contexts, thus providing a robust methodology to decompose complex concurrent systems into multiple layers for modular building and verification. 
The goal of this chapter is to provide high-level descriptions of our methodology to demonstrate how concurrent abstraction layers are built and verified. Later chapters in this dissertation further expose complex aspects of the present work, 
such as a concurrent linking of our approach and a demonstration of the applicability of our method using several examples.
