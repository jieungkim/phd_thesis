The intro for this section is slightly short, but do I need to expand it? I do not think so!}

Concurrent abstraction layers are a common way to build modern software systems because concurrency raised by multicore environment and multithreaded programming are common.
They, however, are hard to get to be right or debug because of complex interleaving among multiple components in the system. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers are highly desirable to provide a 
high-assurance concurrent software development. 

Therefore, we present the way to build and verify concurrent abstraction layers 
based on contextual refinement proofs and environmental contexts,
thus providing a robust methodology to decompose complex concurrent systems into multiple layers for modular building and verification.
The goal of this chapter is not to provide the full details of our concurrent abstraction layers rather the high-level descriptions of our methodology that are required for readers to build concurrent abstraction layers using our method. 
Later chapters in this dissertation further expose complex parts such as the concurrent linking of our approach in detail
and demonstrate the applicability of our methods with several examples.
