Concurrent abstraction layers are a common way to build modern software systems because concurrency raised by multicore environment and multithreaded programming are in common.
They, however, are hard to get to be right or debug because of the complex interleaving among multiple components in the system. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers are highly desirable to provide a 
high-assurance concurrent software development. 

Therefore, we present the way to build and verify concurrent abstraction layers 
based on contextual refinement proofs and environmental contexts;
thus provide a robust methodology to decompose complex concurrent systems into multiple layers for modular building and verification.
The goal of this chapter is not providing the whole details of our concurrent abstraction layers but explains high-level descriptions of our methodology that are required for readers to build concurrent abstraction layers using our method. 
Later chapters in this dissertation further expose complex parts such as concurrent linking of our approach in detail
and demonstrate the applicability of our methods with several examples.
