Concurrent abstraction layers are a common way to build modern software systems because concurrency raised by multicore environment and multithreaded programming are in common.
They, however, are well known to get to be right or to debug due to the complex interleaving among multiple components in the system. 
In this sense, formal treatments of concurrent abstraction layers are highly desirable to provide a 
high-assurance concurrent software development. 

In this sense, we present the way to build and verify concurrent abstraction layers 
based on contextual refinement proofs and environmental contexts;
thus provide a robust methodology to decompose complex concurrent systems into multiple layers for modular building and verification.
The goal of this chapter is providing high-level descriptions of our methodology,
and later chapters demonstrate the applicability of our methods with several examples.
