The MCS Lock is a small but complex piece of low-level software.
It is considered as a standard algorithm for providing inter-CPU locks with FIFO ordering guarantee and scalability.
The MCS Lock is an interesting target for verification---short and subtle, involving both liveness and safety properties. 
To show the applicability of $\ccalname$ presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal},
we implemented and verified the MCS Lock algorithm using the $\ccalname$ toolkit, 
showing that the C/assembly implementation {\em contextually refines} atomic specifications of the acquire and release lock methods.

By using the $\ccalname$ toolkit, splitting the proof into layers are possible by using \textit{fun-lift} and \textit{log-lift} patterns of local layer interface;
thus we can modularize the verification into separate parts for the low-level machine model, data abstraction, and reasoning about concurrent interleavings.
This separation of concerns makes the layered methodology suitable for verified programming in the large, and our 
MCS Lock can be composed with other shared objects.
