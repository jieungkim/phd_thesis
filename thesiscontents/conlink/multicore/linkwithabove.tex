\subsection{Linking with The Layer on Local Layer Interface}
\label{chapter:linking:subsec:linking-with-the-layer-on-local-layer-interface}


We define multiple intermediate languages for multicore linking during this section.
We have also provided the refinement proofs between those intermediate languages which can be further used to link those languages and proofs with the layer on $\compcertx$, the machine model for certified concurrent abstraction layers.
They corresponds to grey boxes in Figure~\ref{fig:chapter:conlink:concurrent-linking-structure} (a),
and we defer those parts to the Section~\ref{chapter:certikos:sec:multicore-linking-for-certikos} since  this part 
is closely related to the instance of concurrent program verification, which is the verification for concurrent $\certikos$ in our case.
