Our previous chapters address how we build 
certified layers via $\ccalname$ to prove concurrent programs and show the example of it, MCS Lock. 
Chapter~\ref{chapter:ccal} also slightly mention that 
providing a  parallel composition rule for 
concurrent layers associated with a partial focused set of participants in the system. 
It, however, does not give us a useful information 
about how they are actually supported in our framework (via connected with all other parts, such as a compiler 
as well as machine models). 
To make them clear, 
we focus on parallel compositions in this Chapter 
by providing 
detailed information and proofs. 


% lining - multicore linking -  a single local laye can be reifned by all composed local layers 
% all composed local layers are actually refined by the multicore machine model 

% linking - multithreaded linking  -  a single local laye can be reifned by all composed local layers 
% all composed local layers are actually refined by the multithreaded machine model, and thus a local lyaer interface with a single CPU.



% Need to provide the proof that I have used in DeepSpec Workshop
