The previous chapter (Chapter~\ref{chapter:wormspace})
illustrates that our verification work on distributed systems, 
a different concurrent program type with multicore/multithreaded concurrent programs. 
It shows that $\ccalname$ can be applied not only to the concurrency by local machines, but also to concurrency in a cluster of multiple machines in distributed protocols. Using the approach, we also verified the safety property of $\WOR$---immutability of each register.
However, verifying a single distributed protocol is insufficient to build large-scale distributed applications because they use multiple distributed systems as their bases.


Proving the correctness of the application requires the verification of the underlying system;
 however, even verifying a single distributed system remains very challenging. 
 In the present paper, we focus on one of the most commonly used families of distributed systems--the leader-based distributed system--and study the standard properties to build a verification framework.
  We propose a generic specification to model leader-based distributed systems. 
  Based on the specification, we present a proof guideline that can verify the common desirable properties of a leader-based system: linearizability and soundness in leader election. 
  Also, our framework uses a novel logical data structure called witness, which tracks the history of each distributed object. 
  This provides a full logical succinct history up to the current status that contains all necessary information for the distributed object.
