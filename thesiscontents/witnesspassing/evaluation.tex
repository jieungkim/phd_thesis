\label{chapter:witnesspassing:sec:evaluation}

Our verification contains two parts, a high-level representation and the low-level implementation of the protocol. 
The shared library that contains basic network template and model, 
data type template, and per-protocol data type template is approximately 2,300 lines of code. 
Specifying the distributed systems using the shared library takes about 800 to 1,000 lines of code
and the verification of individual system takes minimum 10,000 lines of code. 
Still we believe there are opportunities to reduce the lines of code by
introducing user-defined tactics and careful reconstruction of lemmas. 
The explosion of the lines of code is mainly due to
the duplicated codes and low-level code handling in multiple layers.
