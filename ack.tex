I would like to thank everyone who has helped me during my
study and research at Yale University.
First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my
advisor Professor Zhong Shao for his continuous support of my
Ph.D study and research. I am really grateful to him for his
patience, enthusiasm, and many insightful discussions.
I would also like to thank my committee members, Professor
Ruzica Piskac, Mahesh Balakrishnan, and Jan Hoffmann for
the valuable discussions and feedbacks. 
Next, I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude
to my friends and colleagues in the FLINT group at Yale.
My research benefited a lot from collaborations with them.
Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for the
trust, support, and understanding.
