The past seven years at Yale gave me an unforgettable and priceless experience to me. 
Lots of people made my Yale life as a fabulous experience. 
First and foremost, my sincere thanks go to  Professor Zhong Shao, my adviser,  for guiding this work. 
He gave me a wonderful opportunity to work for a Ph.D., and his continuous support of my Ph.D. study and research gives me opportunities to work on multiple exciting projects. 
I also thank my committee members, Professor Ruzica Piskac, Dana Angluin, and Chung-Kil Hur for the valuable reviews, discussions, and feedback regarding my thesis. All other FLINT members also give me great help that aids me to finish my Ph.D. degree successfully. 
Finally, I would like to thank my family, especially my parents.
