Concurrency is ubiquitous. It is not only related to local machines (\eg, multicore hardware or multithreaded programming), 
but also to the external behaviors of the system (\eg, I/O device) and other nodes’ behaviors in a cluster of multiple machines via network communications. 
However, it is  challenging to get right and debug because the behavior of the system contains a number (usually unbounded) of arbitrary interactions and interleaved executions among all system components. 
In this sense, building high-assurance concurrent programs remains challenging; thus, formal verification is desirable because it is the only known method of building bug-free programs. 

However, formal verification requires a considerable cost for adaptation to large-scale system software, 
even without considering concurrency, and becomes more expensive with it. 
Modularization and composition--the fundamental techniques common in building large-scale programs--are also required for verification in order to reduce the cost of developing verified software; 
however, applying them to  verification is subtle due to the correlation of sub-modules or/and instances in the system. 
A software system usually consists of multiple sub-modules that are highly related to others and form multiple concurrently interleaved instances 
(\ie, the mixture of heterogeneous and/or homogeneous instances depending on the system) that interact with others. 
In this sense, a novel modular and compositional verification approach to resolve interactions of sub modules is required for concurrent programs to provide a way to maintain global invariants when building multiple sub-modules that can run with other concurrent components in the full system. 

Moreover, modularity and compositionality are also necessary to reduce the maintenance cost of verified software. 
System software can be extended by adding more services based on current existing modules, 
which increases the local stack of the system. 
Alternatively, adding a new instance into the system can increase its parallel stack.
When some parts of the system have been modified or extended, the proof must also be rebuilt to reflect those changes. 
The cost typically depends on the nature of the changes as well as the invariants that the change affects; 
however, providing a verification approach to minimize the impact of such changes is also necessary. 

Notably, providing an efficient executable code from verified programs without missing the robustness remains another challenge. 
Real-world systems are typically written in a mixture of low-level languages, including C and assembly. 
Thus, verification of these systems requires specific tools to prove the correctness of both C and assembly functions, which requires a proper linking between the proofs for C and assembly codes. 
The obvious and unavoidable step involves performing linking in an assembly level after the C code gets compiled into assembly, 
though this requires trusting the correctness of a compiler that supports modularity as well as compositionality. 
Linking in the presence of the concurrency also requires machine models that can support running multiple instances of the concurrent program. 


In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, this dissertation provides a modular and compositional method of verifying complicated concurrent system software written in C and assembly. 
Specifically, it provides a method of verifying each instance of concurrent programs by following abstraction layer approaches--a conventional technique in building large-scale software--by hiding the complexity of interleaving due to concurrency. 
This work also presents a framework to support linking between multiple proof instances to form full reasoning for concurrent programs. 
Part of this linking work involved building multiple machine models that can be connected without losing generality or the robustness of our proofs. 
In our case studies, we verified $\certikos$--a concurrent operating system that supports fine-grained locking--as well as $\wormspace$, an API that works as a basis for building multiple distributed systems in which the implementation is a collection of multiple $\paxos$ instances. Within the verification of $\certikos$, we also provide detailed work on $\mcsname$ Lock--a small but complex piece of low-level software that is a standard algorithm for providing inter-CPU locks with FIFO ordering guarantee and scalability.


%The MCS Lock, a small but complex piece of low-level software, is a standard algorithm for providing inter-CPU locks with FIFO ordering guarantee and scalability.
%It is an interesting target for verification---short and subtle, involving both liveness and safety properties. 
%We implemented and verified the MCS Lock algorithm as part of the CertiKOS kernel~\cite{certikos:osdi16}, showing that the C/assembly implementation
% {\em contextually refines} atomic specifications of the acquire and release lock methods.
%Our development follows the methodology of \emph{certified concurrent abstraction layers}~\cite{deepspec,concurrency}. 
%By splitting the proof into layers, we can modularize it into separate parts for the low-level machine model, data abstraction, and reasoning about concurrent interleavings.  This separation of concerns makes the layered methodology suitable for verified programming in the large, and our MCS Lock can be composed with other shared objects in CertiKOS kernel.

%Providing the justification of the correctness for the program running on those concurrent environments are notoriously hard.

% They, however, are known to be difficult to get right 
%and debug 
%because multiple instances of 
%the program running on different cores and/or threads 
%provide the number (usually unbounded) of interleavings. 
%
%The number of Interleavings is also a burden in
%concurrent program verification,
%and 
%compositionality is the most promising approach to fight 
%the case explosion due to interleavings.
%In this sense, formal verification is a key to secure and reliable software. 
%
%
%and  Operating System (OS) kernels and hypervisors form the backbone of every safety-critical software system in the world. 
%Hence it is highly desirable to formally verify the correctness of these programs.
%
%Recent work on \selfour~\cite{klein2009sel4,klein14} has shown that it is feasible to formally prove the functional correctness property of a general-purpose microkernel, but the cost of such verification is still quite prohibitive. 
%It took the \selfour\ team more than 11 person years (effort for tool development excluded) to verify 7500 lines of sequential C code, yet the resulting kernel still contains 1200 lines of additional C code and 600 lines of assembly code that are not verified. 
%Worse still, even after all these efforts, the current verified \selfour\ kernel cannot be used to reason about user-level programs as it does not verify important features such as virtual-memory page faults and address translation.
%
%There are many reasons that make hard to verify the OS kernels formally.
%First, OS kernels are complex artifacts; they contain many interdependent components that are difficult to untangle.
%Their invariants can involve machine level details (e.g., how the virtual memory hardware works) but can also cut across multiple abstraction boundaries (e.g., different views of an address space under kernel/user or host/guest modes).
%Several researchers~\cite{baumann12,vaynberg12} observed that even writing down a good and easy-to-maintain formal specification alone is already a major roadblock for any such verification effort.
%
%Second, OS kernels are often written in C, which only supports limited forms of abstraction.  Verification of C programs is especially hard if they manipulate low-level data structures (e.g., thread queues, allocation tables).  
%The \selfour\ effort used an intermediate executable specification (derived from a Haskell prototype) to hide some messy C specifics, but this alone is not enough for enforcing abstraction among different kernel components; \selfour\ had to introduce capabilities which add significant implementation complexities to the kernel.
%
%Third, OS kernels are developed for managing and multiplexing hardware, so it is important to have a machine model that can describe hardware details.
%The C language (especially ANSI C) is too high level for this purpose. For example, while most kernel code can be written in C, many key kernel concepts (e.g., context switches, address translation, page fault handling) can only be given accurate semantics at the assembly level. Consequently, we need a formal assembly model to define many kernel behaviors, but we also want to verify most kernel code at a much higher abstraction level.
%
%Fourth, OS kernel verification would not scale if it does not  support extensibility.
%One advantage of a verified kernel is the existence of formal specifications for all of its components. 
%In theory, this would allow us to add certified kernel plug-ins as long as they do not violate any existing kernel invariants.
%In practice, however, if we are unable to decompose kernel invariants into small independent pieces, even modifying an existing (or adding a new) verified component may force us to rewrite the proofs for the entire kernel.
%
%Hence, OS kernel and hypervisor verification needs a novel compositional approach that can handle all of the above challenges successfully. 
%Previous work~\cite{deepspec} in our group presents a verified OS kernel and hypervisor with solving those problems. 
%However, there are still limitations in two verified kernels~\cite{deepspec, klein2009sel4}.
%For example, both of them only support single processor systems.

%This thesis presents CertiKOS, an extensible architecture for building
%certified sequential and concurrent OS kernels. CertiKOS proposes a
%new compositional framework showing how to formally specify, program,
%verify, and compose concurrent abstraction layers. We present a novel
%language-based account of abstraction layers and show that they
%correspond to a strong form of abstraction over a particularly rich
%class of specifications that we call deep specifications.  We show how
%to instantiate the formal layer-based framework in realistic
%programming languages such as C and assembly, and how to adapt the
%CompCert verified compiler to compile certified C layers such that
%they can be linked with assembly layers.  We can then build and
%compose certified abstraction layers to construct various certified OS
%kernels, each of which guarantees a strong contextual refinement
%property for every kernel function, i.e., the implementation of each
%such function will behave like its specification under any kernel/user
%context with any valid interleaving.
%
%To demonstrate the effectiveness of our new framework, we have
%successfully implemented and verified multiple practical sequential
%and concurrent OS kernels. The most realistic sequential hypervisor
%kernel is written in 6000 lines of C and x86 assembly, and can boot a
%version of Linux as a guest. The general-purpose concurrent OS kernel
%with fine-grained locking can boot on a quad-core hardware. For all
%the certified kernels, their abstraction layers and (contextual)
%functional correctness properties are specified and verified in the
%Coq proof assistant.
