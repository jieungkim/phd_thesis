\section{Trusted Computing Based in CertiKOS}
\label{chapter:conclusion:sec:trusted-computing-based-in-certikos}

We build concurrent operating systems using CCAL, but there are some potholes in the verification. 
Our x86 machine model in the verification assumes sequential consistency instead of the acutal x86 machine mode, x86 TSO.

\section{Timed Behaviors}
\label{chapter:conclusion:sec:timed-behaviors}
TImed behaviors are a basis of real-time software systems.

\section{Better Concurrent Linking Framework}
\label{chapter:conclusion:sec:better-concurrent-linking-framework}

Concurrent linking in our framework is still extremely complex, expensive, and not general enough to applied into any layers as we have shown in Chapter~\ref{chapter:linking}.  

\section{Applying Witness Passing to Other Systems}
\label{chapter:conclusion:sec:applying-witness-passing-to-other-systems}

We presents witness-passing in Chapter~\ref{chapter:witnesspassing}, and show how it can be applied to 
verify other consensus mechanisms such as multiple works in blockchain. 


\section{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion:sec:conclusion}

In this dissertation, we have presented a novel, compositional, practical, and powerful toolkit that can be applied to verify multiple complex system software.
